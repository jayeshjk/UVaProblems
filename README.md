# UVaProblems
I am currently trying my hand at competitive programming. Being a hardcore supporter of bookish approaches I am doing this by following "Competitive Programming 3" by . Also book site is https://cpbook.net/.

This repo contains my accepted solutions to some problems found on https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php

I will keep adding more such solutions until I succeed in keeping my interest alive, which I know, is going to be a difficult task. 

To advanced programmers, this repo is of no use. While beginners and maybe intermediate programmers can find a different approach than what you thought here and maybe we can discuss it. And of course, I will be grateful to receive a constructive feedback towards my methods.
